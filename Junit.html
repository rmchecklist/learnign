Junit:
======
1. @Test - create a testcase method 
        @Test
        public void test(){
        }
2. @Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class) ==> If want to test any exception test case then use this to validate the expected exception
3. @Before/@After - This method will call for each test method, Before will before test and after will after the test method
        e.g. Before-->test1-->After
4. Junit4 --> Junit5
    Maven - Build/Project Management tool can build compile run and create package(jar/war/ear)
    Junit5 has 2 different jar file --> Junit junpiter engine
                                        Junit vintage engine
5. Migrating project from Junit4 to Junit5
    @Before/@After replaced by @BeforeEach/@AfterEach
    All these imports should refer from jupiter
    expected should be replaced by Assertions.assertThrows(NullpointerException.class, ()->{app.greet("")})
    (if Junit is not avaialble on eclipse then we need to install Junit platform runner and Junit jupiter api and add @RunWith(JunitPlatform.class) and then run as Junit 
6. Maven clean --> clean/delete the file under target dir
   Maven install -->  build the jar if all test cases are passed
